 <h1>The Best AP Classes to Take, According to Jason</h1>

 <h2>According to me, these are the best AP Classes of all time.</h2>

 <h3>#3: AP Calculus AB/BC</h3>
 <p>This is a pretty fun class; the problems are simple and there's just a bit to memorize. However, once you understand the basics, the rest is easy.</p>

 <h3>#2: AP English Language & Composition</h3>
 <p>This class actually taught me a great deal about the elements of rhetoric and the strategies to construct a compelling argument. It's grueling, but one comes out stronger the other side. </p>

 <h3>#1: AP Chemistry</h3>
 <p>This class was plain fun. There was a mix of quantitative and qualitative analysis of the various parts of chemistry, mixed in with conceptual applications of various concepts too. You get a little bit of everything in that class. </p>
